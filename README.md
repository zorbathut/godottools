**Zorba's Godot Tools**

This repository contains a bunch of Godot-related game code that people might find useful. Much of it is kind of yanked unceremoniously out of my current project. Browse the directories to see what you can use, then use it.

This is just a placeholder, I haven't actually added anything yet.

This isn't part of *this* repo, but if you want a good framework for a data-driven game and moddability, check out [Dec](https://github.com/zorbathut/dec).
