This repository contains a bunch of Godot-related game code that people might find useful. Much of it is kind of yanked unceremoniously out of my current project and may require some massaging to fit nicely into a new project. Browse the directories to see what you can use, then use it. Enjoy!

Pull requests welcome, bug reports welcome, requests welcome, feedback in general welcome. If you want to talk about things in realtime, hit up [the Dec discord](https://discord.gg/vQv9DMA), which isn't *really* related to this project but isn't entirely unrelated either.

This is just a placeholder, I haven't actually added anything yet.

This isn't part of *this* repo, but if you want a good framework for a data-driven game and moddability, check out [Dec](https://github.com/zorbathut/dec).
